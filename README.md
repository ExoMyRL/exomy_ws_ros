A ROS wrapper for the Exomy rover.

The code makes a connection from the cmd_vel topic to the allready implemented ESA robot control code, making it possible to control the robot by using linear and angular velocities in a Geometry_msgs_TWIST message. 
This branch is primarily used for control of the exomy gazebo simulation.
